argo cd is a declarative continuous deployment tool that you can use to deploy your apps to your kubernetes cluster

continuous deployment tool the way it actually works is you define all your applications manifests all your resources that you want to
deploy in your kubernetes cluster you define all of them in a github repository and then argo cd will pull the changes or will pull the resource definition from github
repository and it deploys the resources for you in your kubernetes cluster.

argo cd are these five components so things might change in the future but as of now in the installed version we have 5 components

the important one is the argo cd server which is the api server all the interactions that you do with orgo cd has to go through this api
server it's like the kube api server for kubernetes and then we have the repo server the repository server
so that's the one that communicates with your external github repository and then it maintains a cache of your github repository
so whenever you do a change in your github repository it pulls every change and then find what has actually changed and
what's the current state of the deployment and so on

we have app controllers app controller component which is responsible for maintaining the state of the deployed
resource in your kubernetes cluster.
redis for caching and then dex server for AD & LDAP authentication. 

so what is it you want to deploy take for example you're deploying a web
application so probably you might create a deployment the deployment will
create a replica set and then the replica set manages the
parts and then you want to expose your web application as a service probably
you need to set up ingress and so on so all these resources are related and
orgo cd manages them as one single app in the orgo cd the way to
interact with orgo cd
